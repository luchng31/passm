## [2026-08-14] Toolchain resolved (T1 unblocked)
- User installed Rust themselves: rustc 1.97.1 + cargo 1.97.1 + clippy/rustfmt/rust-docs/rust-std via rustup at `~/.cargo/bin` (default stable). Well above Tauri 2's 1.77.2 minimum.
- cmake 4.4.2 at `~/.local/bin/cmake` (installed via `pip3 install --user --break-system-packages cmake` — no sudo available).
- **PATH for all build commands: `export PATH="$HOME/.cargo/bin:$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"`** (both rustup and cmake live outside default PATH).
- Quick `cargo new` + `cargo build` smoke test passed → toolchain fully functional.
- Disk: 8.2G free on / (71% used) — enough for git2 vendored + Tauri builds, but watch it.
- Java 17 + Android SDK/NDK still NOT installed (needed for T7/T16) — install before T7.
